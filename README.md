# Money Stuff to Audio 
This code does the following: 
1. Scrape my email to get the latest Matt Levine newsletter. 
2. Convert to audio by sending 1000 word chucks to AWS Polly. 
3. Save all results for future enjoyment. 

## Location of audio results
Currently my Dropbox. Working on a better solution for others to enjoy as well.
